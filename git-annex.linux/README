You can put this directory into your PATH, or symlink the programs in this
directory to anyplace already in your PATH, and use git-annex the same
as if you'd installed it using a package manager.

Or, you can use the runshell script in this directory to start a shell
that is configured to use git-annex and the other utilities included in
this bundle, including git, gpg, rsync, ssh, etc.

This should work on any Linux system of the appropriate architecture.
More or less.


How it works: This directory tree contains a lot of libraries and programs
that git-annex needs. But it's not a chroot. Instead, runshell sets a lot
of environment variables to cause files from here to be used, and a shim
around the binaries arranges for them to be run with the libraries in here.

It shouldn't even be dependent on the host system's glibc libraries.
All that's needed is a kernel that supports the glibc included in this
bundle.
